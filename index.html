                <h3>Other projects</h3>
                <p>Besides the described software, I also made many other creations. I thoroughly investigated the space of static site generators, scripted Roblox games, tinkered with 3D graphics and modelling, created a lot of small websites for personal use (or rather just for enjoyment), and customised my Linux environment by diverse means.</p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I strive to make my software <b>performant</b> and efficient, and to understand thoroughly the dependencies I use, inspired by the <a href="https://handmade.network/">Handmade movement</a>. To achieve this, I study algorithms and learn the inner workings of computer hardware and <b>operating systems</b>.</p>
                <p>Game development is a field that played a big role in my journey to become a programmer. I'm especially interested in <b>procedural generation</b>. It's fascinating to create enormous worlds in a short time using code. Naturally, this also entails dealing with 3D graphics programming (which I explored e.g. by experimenting with Vulkan). I'm impressed by the wonders made by demoscene programmers.</p>
                <p>Some day I would like to learn more about <b>compression</b>, as it seems to be a field where theoretical work has great practical applications. The links of this branch with <b>AI</b> is also fascinating.</p>
                <p>Preparing for programming competitions made me aware of many aspects of software performance. I've been dabbling in <b>competitive programming</b> by participating in the Polish Olympiad in Informatics.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in <b>hardware</b> and <b>embedded programming</b>. I'm researching the principles of the Linux kernel and would like to try driver programming.</p>
                <p>I take an unconventional approach to learning <b>languages</b> and explore the different ways of fostering this process. I'm heavily inspired by the <a href="https://refold.la">Refold</a> community but employ a peculiar variant of their method. I'm also interested in <b>phonology</b> and the ways it makes exchanging thoughts about languages easier. I enjoy discovering the links between different words and I'm curious about the history of languages.</p>
