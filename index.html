                <h3>Other projects</h3>
                <p>Besides the described software, I also made many other creations. I scripted Roblox games (Lua), tinkered with 3D graphics and modelling, created a lot of small websites for personal use (or rather just for enjoyment), and customised my Linux environment by diverse means.</p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I strive to make my software <b>performant</b> and efficient, and to understand thoroughly the dependencies I use, inspired by the <a href="https://handmade.network/">Handmade movement</a>. To achieve this, I study algorithms and learn the inner workings of computer hardware and <b>operating systems</b>. I've been made aware of many aspects of software performance by dabbling in competitive programming, participating in the Polish Olympiad in Informatics.</p>
                <p>Game development is a field that played a big role in my journey to become a programmer. I'm especially interested in <b>procedural generation</b> â it's fascinating to create enormous worlds in a short time using code. Naturally, my experiments entail dealing with 3D graphics programming (which I've explored e.g. by experimenting with Vulkan). I'm impressed by how demoscene programmers push the limits of hardware.</p>
                <p>Some day I would like to learn more about <b>compression</b>, as it seems to be a field where theoretical work has practical applications of great impact. The links this branch has with <b>artificial intelligence</b> are also fascinating. These topics are inextricably related with <b>mathematics</b> and <b>statistics</b>.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in <b>hardware</b> and <b>embedded programming</b>. I'm researching the principles of the Linux kernel and would like to try driver programming.</p>
                <p>I take an unconventional approach to learning <b>languages</b> and explore the different ways of fostering this process. I'm heavily inspired by the <a href="https://refold.la">Refold</a> community but employ a peculiar variant of their method. I'm also interested in <b>phonology</b> and the ways it makes exchanging thoughts about languages easier. I enjoy discovering the links between different words and I'm curious about the history of languages.</p>
                <p>The theory and practice of <b>distributed systems</b> is important for the world of today. Together with the principles of designing scalable and reliable backend infrastructures, this is something I would like to delve into.</p>
